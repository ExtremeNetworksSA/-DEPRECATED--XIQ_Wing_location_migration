# **-Deprecated!-** 
### WiNG Location Migration to XIQ
##### XIQ_wing_migrate.py

This script has been deprecated. It leverages recursive logic to gather location information from XIQ. with the 23r6 release of XIQ, the location hierarchy has been change to require a site, building, and floor. This script will need to be updated to compensate for this change.

Please reach out to tismith@extremenetworks.com if you would like to leverage this script. He can work to make a version that would fit your XIQ hierarchy needs.
